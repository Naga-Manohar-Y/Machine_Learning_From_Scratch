# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains the implementations of popular machine learning algorithms developed as part of the **Machine Learning from Scratch** course on YouTube by AssemblyAI.

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch in Python, without the use of high-level libraries such as `scikit-learn`, providing an educational and practical approach to understanding how these algorithms work under the hood.
